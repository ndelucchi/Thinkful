*Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th:
 
Christmastime will bias availability in two ways-  more AirBnBs may be taken due to vacationers, or fewer AirBnBs may be on offer because people don’t want to share their homes over the holidays.  Choose a sampling period that doesn’t include a major holiday, or reframe the question to focus on popular neighborhoods during major holidays.
 
*Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY:
Given the terrorist attack on NYC the day before, patterns of mental health services use are likely to be very different in the two cities-- even if they were pretty similar on September 10, 2001.  Reframe the question to mental health use in the aftermath of a nearby vs distant crisis, perhaps.
 
 *[Armenian Pub Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/erikhambardzumyan/pubs):
Respondents are all university students.  Reframe to ‘university students’ reasons to visit pubs.’
