A and B= 1.585 * 0 + 1 * 1 + 1.585 + 1.585 + 1 *1 + 0* 4.755 + .585 + .585 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 0*0 = 6.34
A and C = 1.585 * 0 + 1 * 0 + 1.585 * 0 + 1 * 0 + 0 * 0 + .585 * .585 + 0 * 1 + 0 * 1.585 + 0 * 1 = 0.342225

Multiplying the vectors encodes similarity because if two sentences don't share a word, the product is 0.  If two sentences share a word that is very common in the corpus, the product is likely to be less than 1.  But if two sentences share an unusual word, the product can be quite large.   So not only does multiplying the vectors encode similarity, it encodes *meaningful* similarity.
